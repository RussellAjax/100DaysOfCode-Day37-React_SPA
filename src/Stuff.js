			  <p>Speak of the devil, my, of my
			  Walk in with that devlilish smile
			  That's one thing I haven't seen in  a while
			  How have you been since I called you mine?
			  You look so good in this light
			  Got me reminiscin bout our good times

			Been a year since we finished
			Baby, me and you, we vintage
			But tonight you make me miss it
			And I just wanna dance with you like
			It's  summer 1976
			Raise my heart rate like it's interest
			Jog my memory on your kisses
			For old times sake, you got me singing
			</p>
