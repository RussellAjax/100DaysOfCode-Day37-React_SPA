			  <h2>Motion Sickness - Phoebe Bridgers</h2>

			  <p>I hate you for what you did
			And I miss you like a little kid.
			I faked it every time
			But that's alright
			I can hardly feel anything
			I hardly feel anything at all.</p>

			<p>You gave me fifteen hundred
			To see your hypnotherapist
			I only went one time
			You let it slide
			Fell on hard times a year ago
			Was hoping you would let it go, and you did.</p>

			<p>I have emotional motion sickness
			Somebody roll the windows down
			There are no words in the English language
			I could scream to drown you out</p>

			<p>I'm on the outside looking through
			You're throwing rocks around your room
			And while you're bleeding on your back
			In the glass
			I'll be glad that I made it out
			And sorry that it all went down like it did</p>

			<p>I have emotional motion sickness
			Somebody roll the windows down
			There are no words in the English language
			I could scream to drown you out.

			Hey, why do you sing with an English accent?
			I guess it's too late to change it now.
			You know I'm never gonna let you have it.
			But I will try to drown you out</p>
